# CSTBox external dependencies for HTTP based services

Meta-package created for conveniently install external dependencies 
needed by HTTP based CSTBox services (f.i. ext-webui).

It includes the following Python packages :

 - babel ([https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Babel](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Babel))
 - tornado ([http://www.tornadoweb.org](http://www.tornadoweb.org))
 - tornadobabel ([http://tornado-babel.readthedocs.org]((http://tornado-babel.readthedocs.org))

You have been warned ;)
